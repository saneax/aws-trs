aws training repo
1. given a situation where I would like to create some resources on aws via IaaS, ie. terraform,
can you help me design a simple terraform playbook to create an EC2 instance and delete it. Please
take special care in not storing the authentication in the code. I am planning to put this inside
a github repository. This is to learn terraform and aws and using credentials in a safe manner
